>>>>> # New You Japan Fitness


Hello/Konnichiwa
>I'm  George your certified physical trainer at [NYFitnessJapan](index) . Since young I have always been fascinated with physical and mental fitness. It stemmed from growing up in NYC and seeing people from all walks of life. Each individual was very unique because not only did NYC lifestyle promote the everyday hussle and bussle, it was literally a melting pot of people from every culture around the world. Seeing this i was able to make a visual analysis of the different types of people. One group that particularly stuck out to me were asians. Most of them were young in appearance, and not obese like large amounts of people from other cultures i grew up around. Most fit people who were not asian had an understanding and emulated some of asian culture. Fast forwarding to today, i moved to Japan and began to not only embrace Japanese culture but i have became fully aware of the healthy fit lifestyle which is more evident than it is in the states. I want to share my new world with you and help you with the New You.
